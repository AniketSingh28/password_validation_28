# Password Validator (TDD – Python)

This repository contains a simple **Password Validator** implemented in **Python**, developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

The goal of this project is not just to solve a problem, but to demonstrate **clean code**, **incremental design**, and **professional TDD practices**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Implement a function that validates a password based on the following rules:

1. Password must not be empty  
2. Password must have a minimum length of 8 characters  
3. Password must contain at least one digit  
4. Password must contain at least one uppercase letter  
5. Password must contain at least one lowercase letter  
6. Password must contain at least one special character  
7. Password must not contain spaces  

The main function `is_valid(password: str) -> bool` returns `True` if all rules are satisfied, otherwise `False`.
